# Saving-HUB

Welcome to the SAVING Hub Project repository! This project focuses on the integration and analysis of land use, climate change, and health data to enhance public health outcomes in the Brazilian Amazon.

## Project Overview

The SAVING Hub Project aims to combine diverse datasets into a comprehensive data repository and develop a user-friendly interface with a dynamic, real-time monitoring dashboard. This project leverages geo-spatial and temporal data to provide valuable insights into the impact of environmental changes on public health, particularly focusing on snakebite envenomation (SBE) cases in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.
